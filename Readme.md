Robotics Specilization using modern concepts in robotics. A study of kinematics, Dynamics, motion planning and control
of mobile robots and robot arms. The specialization is divided into 5 courses and a Capstone project:
1. Foundation of Robot Motion
2. Robot Kinematics
3. Robot Dynamics
4. Robot motion planning and control
5. Robot manipulation and wheeled mobile robots
6. Capstone project: mobile manipulator

## Results
