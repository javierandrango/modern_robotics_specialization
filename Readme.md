# Modern Robotics Specialization

## Introduction

Robotics Specilization using modern concepts in robotics is available as MOOC(massive open online course) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics)
. A study of kinematics, Dynamics, motion planning and control of mobile robots and robot arms. The specialization is divided into 5 courses and a Capstone project:
1. Foundation of Robot Motion
2. Robot Kinematics
3. Robot Dynamics
4. Robot motion planning and control
5. Robot manipulation and wheeled mobile robots
6. Capstone project: mobile manipulator

## Results

- The results of every exercise represent one solution of many possibilities and belong to the owner of this repository.

- The results were saved in Jupyter Notebooks and Python files.

- The Capstone project includes topics learned in previous the 5 previous courses.

## Usage

- The original Github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/NxRLab/ModernRobotics), the repository includes step by step instructions to follow
also the functions are available for Matlab and Matematica.

- The python code (ModernRobotics library) is commented and mostly self-explanatory in conjunction with the book 
[Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control," Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics). 
An example use is provided with each function.


  To use with Python3 open a command windows and install the package:
  ```cmd
  pip install modern-robotics
  ```
  Open a New Python File and import the library
  ```python
  import modern_robotics as mr
  import numpy as np
  ```
 - For simulation exercises is necessary install The robotics simulator CoppeliaSim
    - I used a laptop with Widnows11, and 6Gb RAM , and the simulation run well all the time.
    - Install [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads) direct from the official page
    - The scenes for the exercises can be found [here](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/CoppeliaSim_Introduction)
    - To import the scenes, first unzip the downloaded file into any directory of your preference, then
    ```code
    File> Open Scene > "Search the unziped folder"> "Open the file with extension .ttt"
    ```
    - The scenes
